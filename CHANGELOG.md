All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `alloc` build feature, for `no_std` builds with an allocator.
  `Name::to_string` and the `gvar-alloc` heap spill no longer require `std`.
  Thanks to [iriswebb](https://github.com/iriswebb).
- (`cmap`) `Subtable4::codepoints_iter` and `Subtable12::codepoints_iter`.
  Unlike `codepoints`, they allow early exit. Both take `self` by value.
  Thanks to [MoSal](https://github.com/MoSal).
- `CFFError::SubroutineCallLimitReached`.
  Thanks to [scadastrangelove](https://github.com/scadastrangelove).
- `core::error::Error` is implemented for `FaceParsingError` in `no_std` builds now.
  Thanks to [iriswebb](https://github.com/iriswebb).
- (`CFF`) `cff::Table::parse_with_upem`, which applies the font matrix using the face's
  units per em. `cff::Table::parse` keeps its original one-argument signature.
  Thanks to [LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV).
- (`OS/2`) `os2::Table::panose`, returning the ten raw PANOSE digits plus `FamilyType`
  and `is_bold`/`is_italic`/`is_monospaced`. The digits are public because their meaning
  depends on the family type and PANOSE defines more values than this crate models.
  `Face::is_bold`, `Face::is_italic` and `Face::is_monospaced` deliberately do not consult
  it: PANOSE is a design classification, not a style flag.
  Thanks to [inferiorhumanorgans](https://github.com/inferiorhumanorgans).

### Changed
- (`loca`) `loca::Table::len` returns `u32` instead of `u16`, and the `Table::Short`/`Table::Long`
  payloads are `LazyArray32` instead of `LazyArray16`.
  Thanks to [asibahi](https://github.com/asibahi).
- The `gvar-alloc` build feature implies `alloc` instead of `std` now.
  A `default-features = false, features = ["gvar-alloc"]` build no longer satisfies
  the `std`/`no-std-float` guard and must select one of them explicitly.
  Thanks to [iriswebb](https://github.com/iriswebb).
- `Face::set_variation` returns `None` for an axis tag the face does not expose.
  It previously returned `Some(())` unconditionally, contradicting its own documentation.
  This is a behavioural change and will not produce a compile error.
  Thanks to [asibahi](https://github.com/asibahi).
- `CFFError` is `#[non_exhaustive]` now, so that future hardening limits can add variants
  without breaking downstream code. Together with the new `SubroutineCallLimitReached`
  variant, this does break existing exhaustive matches on it.
- `Face::is_italic` no longer treats a nonzero `post.italicAngle` as italic. It now consults
  the two flags the spec treats as authoritative: `OS/2.fsSelection` and `head.macStyle` bit 1,
  the latter of which was not parsed at all before. The angle is a slant value that the spec
  only says "should" be 0 for upright faces, and real fonts violate that while rendering
  perfectly upright, so it produced false positives.
  This is a behavioural change and will not produce a compile error.
- (`head`) `head::Table` has a new public `is_italic` field, which breaks exhaustive
  struct destructuring of it.
- (`COLR`) `push_clip` and `pop_clip` are called when painting v0 glyphs, matching v1.
  A `Painter` that relied on v0 never clipping will render differently.
  Thanks to [valadaptive](https://github.com/valadaptive).
- Bump MSRV to 1.88 and move to edition 2024.
- Test fonts and development tools are excluded from the published package, which is
  substantially smaller as a result.
  Thanks to [weiznich](https://github.com/weiznich).
- Dependencies are pinned to a minor version rather than an exact one.
  Thanks to [alerque](https://github.com/alerque).
- Documented the `Face::style` fallback to `Style::Normal` when `OS/2` is absent.
  Thanks to [dereified](https://github.com/dereified).
- Documented every field of `RawFaceTables`.

### Fixed
- (`CFF`) Bound the total number of subroutine invocations per glyph.
  `STACK_LIMIT` bounds nesting depth only, so work grew as fanout^depth:
  a 255-byte `CFF` table hung for over 30 seconds.
  Thanks to [scadastrangelove](https://github.com/scadastrangelove).
- (`GSUB`/`GPOS`) Reject self-referential extension lookups.
  An extension lookup pointing at the extension type recursed unboundedly:
  a stack-overflow abort in debug and an infinite loop in release, from 8 bytes of input.
  Thanks to [scadastrangelove](https://github.com/scadastrangelove).
- (`loca`) Support tables with 65536 offsets.
  A well-formed 65535-glyph font was rejected, `glyf` was dropped entirely
  and every outline returned `None`.
  Thanks to [asibahi](https://github.com/asibahi).
- (`glyf`/`gvar`) Cap the total number of component visits when outlining composite glyphs.
  `MAX_COMPONENTS` bounds chain depth only, so shared child glyphs let sibling components
  force branching^depth re-walks under the cap.
  Thanks to [scadastrangelove](https://github.com/scadastrangelove).
- (`COLR`) Cap the total number of paint-graph node visits in v1 painting.
  The recursion stack bounds path depth but not fan-out, and `layers_count` is a `u8`,
  so a small font could force an enormous traversal.
  Thanks to [scadastrangelove](https://github.com/scadastrangelove).
- (`CFF2`) Guard the `BLEND` operator against an empty argument stack.
  Thanks to [scadastrangelove](https://github.com/scadastrangelove).
- (`CFF`) Glyphs containing the deprecated `dotsection` operator are no longer rejected.
  Previously the whole charstring failed with `UnsupportedOperator`, so glyphs like
  `i`, `j`, `!` and `.` in fonts converted from Type 1 produced no outline at all.
  Thanks to [tobocop2](https://github.com/tobocop2).
- (`GSUB`/`GPOS`) `LazyOffsetArrayIter16` skips `NULL` offsets instead of ending iteration.
  A `NULL` offset hid every later entry, so valid fonts silently lost sequence rule sets.
  Thanks to [asibahi](https://github.com/asibahi).
- (`GSUB`/`GPOS`) `LazyOffsetArrayIter16::count` no longer over-reports by the number of
  skipped entries and agrees with `collect().len()` now.
- (`avar`) `map_value` arithmetic no longer overflows.
  Unvalidated `i16` coordinates could panic in debug or silently invert the sign in release.
  Thanks to [scadastrangelove](https://github.com/scadastrangelove).
- (`fvar`) Read the `HIDDEN_AXIS` flag from bit 0, not bit 3.
  Hidden axes were never reported for conforming fonts.
  Thanks to [SamusAranX](https://github.com/SamusAranX).
- (C API) `ttfp_get_glyph_name` rejects glyph names longer than the documented 256-byte
  buffer instead of panicking across the `extern "C"` boundary, which is a non-unwinding abort.
  Thanks to [scadastrangelove](https://github.com/scadastrangelove).
- (`glyf`) Composite components using point matching no longer desync the parser.
  The two component arguments were consumed only on the `ARGS_ARE_XY_VALUES` path, so an
  unsupported point-matching component left the stream positioned mid-arguments and every
  subsequent read in that glyph decoded from the wrong offset. Point matching itself remains
  unimplemented, but it no longer corrupts the components that follow it.
- (`fvar`) `Face::set_variation` works on a face with exactly 64 axes. Its guard rejected an
  axis count equal to the coordinate-storage limit, while every other site clamps to that
  limit inclusively, so such a face could not be varied on any axis at all.
- `Stream::read_bytes` bounds the requested length against the buffer instead of asserting on
  `offset + len`. The assert was meant to catch caller bugs, but malformed fonts reach it just
  as easily through a `CFF` INDEX count, a `cbdt` PNG length, a `GPOS` class-pair product and
  others, so debug builds aborted on input that release builds rejected cleanly — noise for
  anyone fuzzing a debug build. Checking first also makes the addition sound on 32-bit targets,
  which the assert never did.
- (`HVAR`/`VVAR`/`COLR`) A delta-set index map no longer advances past its buffer before
  reading. `mapCount` is a raw `u32` and the index is scaled by the entry size.
- (`COLR`) Variation delta indices are added with overflow checking. A `varIndexBase` near
  `u32::MAX` aborted in debug and wrapped to an unrelated delta index in release.
- (`CFF`) Glyph outlines are transformed by the font matrix. Fonts with a non-default
  `FontMatrix` were outlined at the wrong scale.
  Thanks to [tbodt](https://github.com/tbodt).
- (`CFF2`) Fonts without a `vstore` can outline glyphs. The Top DICT entry is optional per
  spec, but variation scalars were resolved at index 0 before the first operator ran, which
  fails on an absent store — so every glyph of a static CFF2 font returned `None`. Scalars are
  now resolved on first `blend` instead, which is the only operator that needs them.
- (`gvar`) Outlining a variable glyph no longer aborts under `-Zrandomize-layout`.
  Two `debug_assert!`s bounded the size of internal iterator structs, but Rust does not
  guarantee `repr(Rust)` layout and randomization pushed them past the bound, so every debug
  build of every application using the flag panicked on a budget it could not influence.
  The bounds are now checked in this crate's own test suite instead.

  Thanks to [OrionNebula](https://github.com/OrionNebula)

## [0.13.1] - 2021-10-27
### Fixed
- `Face::line_gap` logic.

## [0.13.0] - 2021-10-24
### Added
- Complete GSUB and GPOS tables support. Available under the `opentype-layout` feature.
- Public access to all supported TrueType tables. This allows a low-level, but still safe,
  access to internal data layout, which can be used for performance optimization, like caching.
- `Style` enum and `Face::style` method.
- `Face::glyph_name` can be disabled via the `glyph-names` feature to reduce binary size.

### Changed
- Improved ascender/descender/line_gap resolving logic.
- `Face` methods: `has_glyph_classes`, `glyph_class`, `glyph_mark_attachment_class`,
  `is_mark_glyph` and `glyph_variation_delta` are moved to `gdef::Table`.
- The `Names` struct is no longer an iterator, but a container.
  You have to call `into_iter()` manually.
- The `VariationAxes` struct is no longer an iterator, but a container.
  You have to call `into_iter()` manually.
- Most of the `Name` struct methods become public fields.
- `Face::units_per_em` no longer returns `Option`.
- (`cmap`) Improved subtable 12 performance. Thanks to [xnuk](https://github.com/xnuk)

### Removed
- (c-api) `ttfp_glyph_class`, `ttfp_get_glyph_class`, `ttfp_get_glyph_mark_attachment_class`,
  `ttfp_is_mark_glyph`, `ttfp_glyph_variation_delta` and `ttfp_has_table`.
- `TableName` enum and `Face::has_table`. Tables can be access directly now.
- `Face::character_mapping_subtables`. Use `Face::tables().cmap` instead.
- `Face::kerning_subtables`. Use `Face::tables().kern` instead.

### Fixed
- `Iterator::count` implementation for `cmap::Subtables`, `name::Names` and `LazyArrayIter32`.

## [0.12.3] - 2021-06-27
### Changed
- (`glyf`) Always use a calculated bbox.

## [0.12.2] - 2021-06-11
### Fixed
- `Face::glyph_bounding_box` for variable `glyf`.
- (`glyf`) Do not skip glyphs with zero-sized bbox.

## [0.12.1] - 2021-05-24
### Added
- Support Format 13 subtables in `cmap::Subtable::is_unicode`.
  Thanks to [csmulhern](https://github.com/csmulhern)
- Derive more traits by default. Thanks to [dhardy](https://github.com/dhardy)

## [0.12.0] - 2021-02-14
### Changed
- `Face::ascender` and `Face::descender` will use
  [usWinAscent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#uswinascent) and
  [usWinDescent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#uswindescent)
  when `USE_TYPO_METRICS` flag is not set in `OS/2` table.
  Previously, those values were ignored and
  [hhea::ascender](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/hhea#ascender) and
  [hhea::descender](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/hhea#descender)
  were used. Now `hhea` table values will be used only when `OS/2` table is not present.
- `Face::outline_glyph` and `Face::glyph_bounding_box` in case of a `glyf` table
  can fallback to a calculated bbox when the embedded bbox is malformed now.

## [0.11.0] - 2021-02-04
### Added
- `FaceTables`, which allowed to load `Face` not only from a single chunk of data,
  but also in a per-table way. Which is useful for WOFF parsing.
  No changes to the API.
  Thanks to [fschutt](https://github.com/fschutt)

## [0.10.1] - 2021-01-21
### Changed
- Update a font used for tests.

## [0.10.0] - 2021-01-16
### Added
- `variable-fonts` build feature. Enabled by default.
  By disabling it you can reduce `ttf-parser` binary size overhead almost twice.

### Changed
- (`gvar`) Increase the maximum number of variation tuples from 16 to 32.
  Increases stack usage and makes `gvar` parsing 10% slower now.

### Fixed
- (`CFF`) Fix `seac` processing. Thanks to [wezm](https://github.com/wezm)

## [0.9.0] - 2020-12-05
### Removed
- `kern` AAT subtable 1 aka `kern::state_machine`.
  Mainly because it's useless without a proper shaping.

## [0.8.3] - 2020-11-15

- The `cmap` module became public.

### Fixed
- `Face::width` parsing.
- Possible u32 overflow on 32-bit platforms during `Face::from_slice`.
- (cmap) `Face::glyph_variation_index` processing when the encoding table has only one glyph.

## [0.7.0] - 2020-07-16
### Added
- (CFF) CID fonts support.
- (CFF) `seac` support.
- `Font::global_bounding_box`

### Changed
- Rename `Font` to `Face`, because this is what it actually is.
- Rename `Font::from_data` to `Font::from_slice` to match serde and other libraries.
- Rename `Name::name_utf8` to `Name::to_string`.

### Removed

## [0.6.2] - 2020-07-02
### Added
- `Name::is_unicode`
- `Font::family_name` will load names with Windows Symbol encoding now.

### Fixed
- `Font::glyph_bounding_box` will apply variation in case of `gvar` fonts.

## [0.6.1] - 2020-05-19
### Fixed
- (`kern`) Support fonts that ignore the subtable size limit.

## [0.6.0] - 2020-05-18
### Added
- `sbix`, `CBLC`, `CBDT` and `SVG` tables support.
- `Font::glyph_raster_image` and `Font::glyph_svg_image`.
- `Font::kerning_subtables` with subtable formats 0..3 support.

### Changed
- (c-api) The library doesn't allocate `ttfp_font` anymore. All allocations should be
  handled by the caller from now.

### Removed
- `Font::glyphs_kerning`. Use `Font::kerning_subtables` instead.
- (c-api) `ttfp_create_font` and `ttfp_destroy_font`.
  Use `ttfp_font_size_of` + `ttfp_font_init` instead.
  ```c
  ttfp_font *font = (ttfp_font*)alloca(ttfp_font_size_of());
  ttfp_font_init(font_data, font_data_size, 0, font);
  ```
- Logging support. We haven't used it anyway.

### Fixed
- (`gvar`) Integer overflow.
- (`cmap`) Integer overflow during subtable format 2 parsing.
- (`CFF`, `CFF2`) DICT number parsing.
- `Font::glyph_*_advance` will return `None` when glyph ID
  is larger than the number of metrics in the table.
- Ignore variation offset in `Font::glyph_*_advance` and `Font::glyph_*_side_bearing`
  when `HVAR`/`VVAR` tables are missing.
  Previously returned `None` which is incorrect.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-03-19
### Added
- Variable fonts support.
- C API.
- `gvar`, `CFF2`, `avar`, `fvar`, `HVAR`, `VVAR` and `MVAR` tables support.
- `Font::variation_axes`
- `Font::set_variation`
- `Font::is_variable`
- `Tag` type.

### Fixed
- Multiple issues due to arithmetic overflow.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-02-24

**A major rewrite.**

### Added
- `Font::glyph_bounding_box`
- `Font::glyph_name`
- `Font::has_glyph_classes`
- `Font::glyph_class`
- `Font::glyph_mark_attachment_class`
- `Font::is_mark_glyph`
- `Font::glyph_y_origin`
- `Font::vertical_ascender`
- `Font::vertical_descender`
- `Font::vertical_height`
- `Font::vertical_line_gap`
- Optional `log` dependency.

### Changed
- `Font::outline_glyph` now accepts `&mut dyn OutlineBuilder` and not `&mut impl OutlineBuilder`.
- `Font::ascender`, `Font::descender` and `Font::line_gap` will check `USE_TYPO_METRICS`
  flag in OS/2 table now.
- `glyph_hor_metrics` was split into `glyph_hor_advance` and `glyph_hor_side_bearing`.
- `glyph_ver_metrics` was split into `glyph_ver_advance` and `glyph_ver_side_bearing`.
- `CFFError` is no longer public.

### Removed
- `Error` enum. All methods will return `Option<T>` now.
- All `unsafe`.

### Fixed
- `glyph_hor_side_bearing` parsing when the number of metrics is less than the total number of glyphs.
- Multiple CFF parsing fixes. The parser is more strict now.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-09-26
### Added
- `no_std` compatibility.

### Changed
- The library has one `unsafe` block now.
- 35% faster `family_name()` method.
- 25% faster `from_data()` method for TrueType fonts.
- The `Name` struct has a new API. Public fields became public functions
  and data is parsed on demand and not beforehand.

## [0.2.2] - 2019-08-12
### Fixed
- Allow format 12 subtables with *Unicode full repertoire* in `cmap`.

## [0.2.1] - 2019-08-12
### Fixed
- Check that `cmap` subtable encoding is Unicode.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-07-10
### Added
- CFF support.
- Basic kerning support.
- All `cmap` subtable formats except Mixed Coverage (8) are supported.
- Vertical metrics querying from the `vmtx` table.
- OpenType fonts are allowed now.

### Changed
- A major rewrite. TrueType tables are no longer public.
- Use `GlyphId` instead of `u16`.

### Removed
- `GDEF` table parsing.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-06-18
### Added
- Initial release. Parsing of `cmap`, `glyf`, `head`, `hhea`, `hmtx`, `loca`, `maxp`, `name`,
  `OS/2`, `post`, `vhea` and `vmtx`, with `GDEF` and font-collection support.
